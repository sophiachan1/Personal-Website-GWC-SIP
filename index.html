    <main>
     <p> My name is Sophia Chan and I am currently a 17 year old, upcoming highschool senior living in California. When it comes to coding, I am very much a beginner. But besides being interested in coding, I like to listen to music, binge watch T.V. shows, and do jigsaw puzzles in my free time. At this point, I really don't know what I want to do with my life but I can only hope to find and do something I love and whatever happens will happen.</p> 

     <p>So I present to you my website where you can learn and get to know me better through my portfolio.</p>
